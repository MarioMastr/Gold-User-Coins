The epic texture swapping mod by the best smelling cologne in the GD community himself... now **without patches**!

This was mainly done as an excuse to learn some raw reverse engineering (thank you to whoever leaked IDA 9.0 for your immense hard work ðŸ«¡), but also to make this mod truly multi-platform.
This mod does use some bindings that aren't currently unavailable for m1 and mainly imac atm, but I have put them in my repo so if you want to build this you can clone my repo and then set the GEODE_BINDINGS_REPO_PATH env variable to the path of my cloned repo.

This does result in a little bit of a conflict with QOLMod (but honestly everything does so don't worry too much).
